# 🚀 Multi-Agent Content Generation System

This project is a Python-based multi-agent content generation system designed to demonstrate how a modular, production-style automation pipeline can transform a structured product dataset into multiple machine-readable JSON content pages. The system uses independent agents, reusable logic blocks, a custom template engine, and a centralized orchestrator to automatically generate a FAQ page, a product description page, and a comparison page with a fictional product. The focus of the project is on clean system architecture, agent orchestration, and deterministic, structured output generation rather than UI or prompt-based content creation.
